# Tuim's ELF Interpreter for Linux

## Download

For now Tuim is distributed only in source form.

You can can get it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ismaeldamiao/tuim
cd tuim
```

## Building from source

Make sure you have:
- GNU Make
- A C compiler and linker

First navigate to the `tuim` directory and set up the environment.

```bash
cd tuim
. etc/profile.d/environment-clang.sh # if your compiler is LLVM CLang
. etc/profile.d/environment-gcc.sh   # if your compiler is GCC
```

Now make:

```bash
make tuim tuim/arch.h
```
