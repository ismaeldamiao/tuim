\section{Applicatiob Binary Interface}

A environment abble to execute portable objects need to follow some
\textbf{a}pplication \textbf{b}inary \textbf{i}nterface (ABI).
Here is specified a ABI for that purpose.

For the purposes of this document
a software that shall be executed is called \textbf{application}.
The \textbf{interpreter} is the application responsible to read object code
holding another application's code and execute it.
The application's \textbf{entry point} the place of a routine
that do the application's task,
that routine may request services from libraries by branching
to routines on that libraries.
Eventually the application may, but is not required to,
return the execution control to the interpreter.

\subsection{Object code}

The file format used for object code is the
\textbf{e}xecutable and \textbf{l}inkable \textbf{f}ormat (ELF)
as specified in chapters 3 and 4 of System V ABI\cite{sysv}.
No extension are suppoed exept if explitly specified.

Executables and shared objects
are allowed to have only position independent code.
